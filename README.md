# 👋 Hi there, I'm Elena!

🔧 I'm a Mechatronics student passionate about integrating hardware and software to create smart systems.

## 💡 Projects

Here are some of the things I've been building:

### 🔹 Arduino Projects
- **[Bluetooth Control](https://github.com/elecavazza/control-arduino-using-bluetooth)**  
  Control Arduino wirelessly via an Android app.

- **[Conveyor Belt Challenge](https://github.com/elecavazza/arduino-conveyor-belt)**  
  A mini industrial automation setup using Arduino.

### 🔹 SCADA Systems with LabVIEW
- **[Heating Control System](https://github.com/elecavazza/scada-labview-heating-control-system)**  
  Temperature control using LabVIEW with real-time data logging.
  
- **[Tank State Machine](https://github.com/elecavazza/scada-labview-tank-state-machine)**  
  Simulates a tank process with state transitions using LabVIEW.
  
- **[Climate Control System](https://github.com/elecavazza/scada-labview-climate-control)**  
  SCADA for air conditioning, managing temperature and humidity.

- **[Vending Machine Simulation](https://github.com/elecavazza/scada-labview-vending-machine)**  
  Models a vending machine using state machines in LabVIEW.
